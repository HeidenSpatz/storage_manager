## Executive Summary

This document outlines the core principles for maintaining an efficient and streamlined codebase in the stock analysis project.

## Project Principles

### 1. Token Efficiency
- Keep the number of files in the project to a minimum
- Maintain minimal file lengths wherever possible
- **Rationale:** Optimizes token efficiency for both Claude and user interactions

### 2. Cost-Conscious Development
- Every non-essential element in the project has an associated cost


### 3. Archive Management
- Move non-essential materials to an archive folder
- Keep archived content out of view and regular processing
- Archived materials remain accessible when needed
- Claude should routinely ignore the archive folder unless explicitly instructed otherwise

## Recommended Action:
1. Regularly evaluate project components for necessity
